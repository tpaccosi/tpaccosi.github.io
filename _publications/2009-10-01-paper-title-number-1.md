title: "Benchmarking the Semantics of Taste: Towards the Automatic Extraction of Gustatory Language"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/Benchmarking-Taste
excerpt: 'In this paper, we present a benchmark containing texts manually annotated with gustatory semantic information. We employ a FrameNet-like approach previously tested to address olfactory language, which we adapt to capture gustatory events. We then propose an exploration of the data in the benchmark to show the possible insights brought by this type of approach, addressing the investigation of emotional valence in text genres. Eventually, we present a supervised system trained with the taste benchmark for the extraction of gustatory information from historical and contemporary texts.'
